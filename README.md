# Old-RPGProject-JAVA-

I was digging through some old files and found this
mini project I was working on back in high school.
It kept me busy in class when I finished my other
assignments. Very simplistic, ran and played on a
command prompt. Obviously, there are quite a bit
of issues with the actual gameplay and the abundance
of if/else statements, but I remember being excited
and having fun with making my first game.

There was another project similar to this which
involved a text-based traversal through a fantasy
world, using recursions and even more if/else
statements, but some of the files/classes are
missing.
